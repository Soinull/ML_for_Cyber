# ML_for_Cyber
My deck for my talk at CodeFreeze at the University of Minnesota "The Real World Application of ML to Cybersecurity"

Abstract:
In this talk we’ll look at a couple real world implementations of ML to solve Cyber Security challenges. We’ll delve into the code and explore the challenges and benefits of applying ML to Cyber Security problems. ML brings some powerful options to meeting today's Cyber Security needs but many approaches such as anomaly detection-based ones tend to fail utterly while other approaches produce amazing results. We’ll dive into each side and seek to give you a practical understanding of how to successfully leverage ML for Cyber Security.
